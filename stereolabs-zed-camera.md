## Before Purchasing

Check the specs on the [store page](https://www.stereolabs.com/store/), and decide which model to purchase.

In general, `ZED 2` > `ZED-M` > `ZED 1`.

## Quick Start

1. Follow this [Quick Start Guide](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/installation/) and download the SDK with preferred CUDA version.
2. Install NVIDIA CUDA, with the same version of ZED SDK.
3. Install the ZED SDK, with all `Yes`.
4. Verify the SDK is installed with `/usr/local/zed/tools/ZED_Explorer`.
5. Install the [Python package](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/app-development/python/install/).
6. Download and run the [Camera Control example](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-examples/tree/master/camera%20control/python).

More details are provided in the [Getting Started](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/getting-started/) page.
